#summary Why I created the project

=Background=
The project was originally intended to prove that Java is just as fast as C as most, if not all, routers software are written in C.

=Components=
Traditionally, router software was a big piece of code with tons of features, where most users would actually use only a very small part of it. This introduced unnecessary complexity to the otherwise, very simple flow of usage.
One of the goals of this project is to implement components that can be replaced easily. Components like checksum calculation, routing algorithm or even TCP stack can be replaced by importing a different library.

=Experimental networking=
Another interesting aspect of the project is that it provides a platform that is easy to test out experimental technologies. For example, hierarchical IP address routing instead of OSPF, networking other than IP...etc.
