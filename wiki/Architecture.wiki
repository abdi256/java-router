#summary Architectural overview of Java Router

= Overview =

The Java Router uses a callback approach to process packets. The network packets are read at the Port classes continuously. The classes provide registration interface for others to obtain the packets. For example, EthernetPort provides registration to listen to a particular ethertype.

Similar to a realtime system, if possible, each packet is processed until it is being routed out of the box.

= Configuration =

Jython is simple enough to be embedded as a configuration interface to run Java Router in anyway the users need. Certain templates are provided in order to simplify the main configuration.
The goal is to achieve the simplicity of a command line interface, but still abides to Python syntax.
