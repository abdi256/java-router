#summary A publish/subscribe interface between different components

A publish/subscribe interface links different components together. This is used for packets going to higher level protocol processing. Higher levels subscribe to publishers of lower levels.

The publishers define the type T that can be subscribed to. For example, EthernetPort provides subscription to different Ethertype.
