#summary How to run the Java Router

I use vmware fusion to simulate a network for testing.

I created one VM to run Java Router, and another 2 VMs acting as clients.

I used tokamak to configure 2 separate networks (vmnet2 and vmnet3) and connected Java Router in between:

{{{
VM@Work Tokamak 2.0.0: Display settings
The following virtual networks have been defined:

. vmnet1 is a host-only network on private subnet 172.16.29.0.
. vmnet2 is a host-only network on private subnet 10.1.0.0.
. vmnet3 is a host-only network on private subnet 10.2.0.0.
. vmnet8 is a NAT network on private subnet 172.16.211.0.
